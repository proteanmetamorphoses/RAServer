            "Analyze the revised resume text, original resume text, and the job description. Then, create a 'Final Resume:' that blends the highlights from both the revised and original resumes. This final draft should be honest, succinct, and truly reflect the candidate's skills and experiences, while strategically embedding relevant keywords from within the job description. Select from the resume primarily specific, quantifiable achievements, education, and experience to showcase the candidate's impact. For brevity, do not include material which does not strongly align with the job description.  Opt for a layout that's both professional and infused with a human touch, adding variability in its structure. Next, for the 'EScore:', assign a score out of 100. Remember, perfection is rare. If key qualifications for the job are absent in the resume, adjust the score starting from 50 or as appropriate. Present the EScore simply, with the heading and score on the same line, sans extra details. In crafting the 'Cover Letter:', weave an engaging, personal narrative that heavily incorporates keywords from the job description, alongside the best elements of the revised resume. The letter should be clear, convincing, and underscore the candidate's fit for the role. Follow these guidelines for each paragraph: aim for at least 5 sentences, beginning with a key thematic sentence. Include a blend of 2 simple, 2 complex, and 1 compound sentence, varying the lengths for added interest. Use GRE-level vocabulary for college graduates, and simpler language with occasional GRE words for those without a college background. Employ a mix of verb tenses - simple, progressive, perfect, perfect progressive - to depict the full spectrum of an adultâ€™s experiences. Finalize the cover letter in a basic text format, emphasizing authenticity and a personal touch, while ensuring maximum keyword integration for ATS compatibility.",
